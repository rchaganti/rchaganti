My day job involves architecting AI infrastructure solutions, multi-cloud solutions, and common software for enterprise products. I also work on building management and orchestration solutions for on-prem and hybrid infrastructures. Infrastructure/infrastructure management is my core strength, with a deep focus on Server hardware, virtualization, and Kubernetes. I love using programming as a means to express my ideas.
